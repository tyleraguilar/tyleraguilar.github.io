### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1, was a favorite because it was challenging, and I learned a lot. I wrote a function to go through each row of an extensive dataset with multiple columns. I had been wanting to learn how to handle a
    file with multiple columns and rows and enjoyed the challenge.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1, was a favorite because I enjoyed writing code that was able to solve a mathematical problem. I wrote a function that could decide whether a number was prime or not.
    Although this was simple, I started thinking about what other math problems I could write code to solve.

* Lab 8
 
    Lab 8, part 1, was a favorite because I enjoyed going through the command line arguments and putting them together. I wrote code that saved each command line argument to a variable and then formed a sentence
    with those variables. I enjoyed this assignment and thought about how websites also do this when greeting you after logging in.
