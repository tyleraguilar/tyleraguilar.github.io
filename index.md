### CPSC 120

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-tyler-and-abhishek.git)

    Lab 11, part 1, was a favorite because it was challenging, and I learned a lot. I wrote a function to go through each row of an extensive dataset with multiple columns. I had been wanting to learn how to handle a
    file with multiple columns and rows and enjoyed the challenge.

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-audrey-and-tyler.git)

    Lab 10, part 1, was a favorite because I enjoyed writing code that was able to solve a mathematical problem. I wrote a function that could decide whether a number was prime or not.
    Although this was simple, I started thinking about what other math problems I could write code to solve.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-tyler-and-richard.git)
 
    Lab 8, part 1, was a favorite because I enjoyed going through the command line arguments and putting them together. I wrote code that saved each command line argument to a variable and then formed a sentence
    with those variables. I enjoyed this assignment and thought about how websites also do this when greeting you after logging in.
